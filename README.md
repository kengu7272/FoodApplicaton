# FoodApplicaton

This was just a sample project from my Software Engineering class in Fall of 2022

First time using external libraries and making API calls

My contributions to this project include making API requests to a food database to get information about foods
as well as having a water intake tracker

My code: search.h, search.cpp, and waterintake.h, waterintake.cpp
